Created by Dawn Sargent and Mattison Johnson.
The GeneratingData folder contains a file for running the Monte Carlo simulation, and a file for combining the separate data files that it generates into one large file.
Then there is also the file KDE for the kernel density estimates, and the file KNN for the k-nearest neighbor.
The presentation we gave at NASA is also included, and contains our contact information on the last slide.
Thank you!
